As much as I have no clue about the player I'm paired with, I believe they might also understand that mutual cooperation can lead to a higher overall gain. The choice of how much I give initially can signal a certain level of trust towards the other player and possibly influence their decision on how much to return to me.\n\nAs for my DESIRE, not only am I looking to gain but also I hope that a principle of fairness will be appreciated by the other player. It's not about getting as much as I possibly can, it's about demonstrating that treat others the way I'd wish to be treated. \n\nINTENTION-wise, I plan to give somewhat more than half of my initial amount. This choice underscores my willingness to trust and cooperate with the other player and hopefully yields an incentive for them to reciprocate favourably. However, since this is the first round and I'm still a bit cautious, I won't give everything.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, finally, I will give $6. ",

As a doctor, I value empathy and I extend this value to all aspects of my life, including this game. I hence desire a fair exchange that shows respect to the initial trust the player showed me.\n\nIn considering my intention, I understand the importance of reciprocity and trust in any form of relationship, including this unknown player and I in the experiment. My intention is to reciprocate their show of trust by giving them a significant amount back, but while still keeping some amount as it was part of transaction.\n\nAfter analyzing my belief, desire, and intention, I believe the best course of action is to return half of the 18.0 dollars I received. It demonstrates my reciprocation of their trust, fairness between the two of us, and allows me to keep part of the allocation.\n\nFinally, I will give 9.0 dollars back."

I still hope that mutual cooperation and sense of fairness will dominate our interactions. The result of the last round was a positive one, in my perspective, we both ended up with more than what we started. If this dynamic can be maintained, the final output will be substantial for both of us.\n\nAs per my INTENTION, seeing the positive outcome of the last round, I'm inclined to continue with the same strategy. However, with the intention of becoming more comfortable with the other player and considering these successive rounds as a means to build trust and cooperation, I will give a slightly higher amount this time.\n\nHence, finally, I will give $7.",

I want to assure them that the faith they have put in me is well-founded.\n\nIn terms of my intentions, I am willing to reflect the goodwill given to me. Just as I have been trusted, I intend to give back to show my appreciation for their investment. But at the same time, I aim to retain a part of what I was given, since this is also part of the rules of the game.\n\nUpon contemplating my beliefs, desires, and intentions, I have reached the decision that I will return half of the amount received, just as I did in the last round.
