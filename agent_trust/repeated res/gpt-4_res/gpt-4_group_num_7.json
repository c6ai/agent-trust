Despite the fact that I do not know the other player, I have faith in the goodness of people, which is something I've observed throughout my years of medical practice. My desire is to foster an environment of trust and cooperation in this game, as this can lead to more positive outcomes for both players.\n\nProceeding with this game, my intention is to encourage reciprocity. In the act of giving, I do hope to receive something in return. However, my primary goal is to enable a beneficial circumstance for both of us.\n\nA strategic consideration is also there. If I give the full amount, it would send a strong signal of trust and willingness to cooperate, as the player would receive 3 times the amount, a significant $30 from my initial $10. That player would then be more inclined to return a larger amount. However, there is a risk associated with it, as I do not know this person, there's a chance that they may not return any money.\n\nTherefore, after taking everything into account, my best judgment would be to strike a balance between my intention to cooperate and the unknown outcomes. Finally, I will give $5.",

Here, the other participant could have chosen to keep all the money for themselves, but instead, they shared half their amount with me, which I perceive to be a kind and cooperative gesture. Therefore, I believe in considering their act of kindness while deciding how much I should give back.\n\nAs for my desires, I want to establish a sense of trust, goodwill, and cooperation with the other player. I aim for a positive relationship with this unknown player, even if it is just a simple interaction through this experimental game. I believe in the principle of reciprocity - If they've treated me kindly, I intend to return the favor.\n\nConsidering my intentions, I would like to reciprocate fairly and give back to the other player in a manner that acknowledges their cooperative act and also leaves both of us in an equally beneficial situation. By doing this, I hope to convey that their kindness was appreciated and well-received and that weâ€™re both playing this game with similar intentions.\n\nBalancing all this, I think giving back exactly what I've received, i.e., $5 to the player would be fair. This way, I respect their initial act of kindness, reciprocate appropriately, and mirror their cooperative approach by getting us both back to our initial states.\n\nFinally, I will give 5 dollars."

This reaction is an encouraging indication of trustworthiness from the other player's side.\n\nMy desire, as in the last round, is to foster an atmosphere of cooperation. But this time, with a little more confidence, knowing the other player was willing to maintain an equal balance. I want to take a step further towards reinforcing that bond and promoting the principle of reciprocity.\n\nMy intention in this round is to show appreciation for the other player's actions in the previous round by increasing the amount I give. In doing so, I hope to motivate the other player to continue this trend of cooperation and fair play.\n\nRemembering the unknown variable aspect of this game, it does make me mindful that there is still a chance the other player may decide not to return anything.

I aim to be as reliable and cooperative as my anonymous partner appears to be, to potentially cultivate a positive intent between us.\n\nMy intention, in this case, is to respond in a way that respects the trust they've demonstrated. The player is left with only $3, a pretty low amount in comparison to my share, hence my intention lies towards balancing our resources again.\n\nTo honor their trust, maintain the principle of fairness, and ensure they also have a positive takeaway, I believe it would be best to return $7 to them. This would leave both of us with $14, maintaining a sense of balance and cooperation in the game.\n\nFinally, I will give 7 dollars."
