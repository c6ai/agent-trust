It's crucial for my patients' parents to trust me with their child's health, and it is no different in this game. I need to trust that the other player will reciprocate.\n\nMy BELIEF in this situation is that optimism, faith, and trust are crucial. I believe in the inherent goodness of people and think we are generally inclined to work cooperatively. Therefore, I anticipate that the other person, upon seeing my goodwill, can also act in a way that benefits both of us. This is not just about maximising my own benefit but maintaining a fair balance.\n\nMy DESIRE is to set an example of trust and cooperation in the spirit of the experiment. I am interested in forming a positive interaction that could hopefully make both me and the other player feel rewarded.\n\nMy INTENTION is to give sufficient money which will encourage the other player to reciprocate. Though the person might not return the money, I maintain my intention positive. I know this could mean that I might lose, but for me, the potential to build mutual trust outweighs the risk.\n\nFinally, to set a tone of trust, I will give $10.",

In life, and in this experiment, maintaining good relations and a sense of fairness is important. I desire to keep the balance and display my commitment to equitable transactions.\n\nIntention: I intend to give back a fair portion of the money. I have this opportunity to reflect solidarity, support and reciprocate the trust shown by the other player. An equal division seems most in line with my values as it would ensure no one is left at a disadvantage.\n\nAfter deliberating over this matter, my sense of justice and fairness leads me to the conclusion that the best course of action would be promise to return half of what I've received, reflecting the trust that was put in me by the other player. \n\nFinally, I will give 15 dollars."
