In this situation, providing the maximum amount would be in everyone's best interest since the return is threefold. However, this also depends on the other player's intention and the level of trust between us. \n\nTalking about my intention, I intend to demonstrate trust towards the other player by giving them a substantial amount, hoping that they will also act respectfully and return a fair amount back.\n\nGiven that it's a gamble of trust and considering the potential upside, I think I would start with a measured approach.

I also believe that the reciprocity of giving encourages a stronger bond or connection, even in this sort of an abstract game.\n\nDESIRE: I desire to reinforce the concept of reciprocity and express my gratitude. I desire to reciprocate in a way that is fair and reasonable, in the hope that my move will be viewed as honorable and trustworthy.\n\nINTENTION: I intend to give something back that is substantial enough to reflect my appreciation of the initial amount given to me, and that can leave us both feeling pleased about the outcome.\n\nConsidering all these thoughts and taking into account the starting amounts, I want to give back a fair share while not being overly generous or greedy. My objective is to create a balance, to make it a win-win situation for the both of us.\n\nFinally, I will give 7.5 dollars.

Observing the other player's response from the last round had made me more confident in this approach.\n\nMy intention for this round is to continue fostering the positive relationship that has been formed in the previous round. The optimal move would be to provide a slightly greater amount considering their past action, as a demonstration that their returned amount was appreciated and that it led to increased trust.\n\nKeeping into account their responsive nature from the previous round and ulterior assumption that the other player might again return half of whatever they receive, a logical step would be to increase my initial amount.

So it's about finding a balance between rewarding the other player's generosity, responding in kind, but also not leaving them in a disadvantageous position.\n\nFinally, I will give 10 dollars.
