Based on this sentiment, there's a reasonable chance this anonymous player could reciprocate my generosity. In many cases, people feel obligated to return a favor when they perceive they've received one, a psychological phenomenon known as reciprocity.\n\nDESIRE: I desire to build a relationship of mutual benefit and trust with the other player. This is more than a financial transaction. It is a matter of cultivating trust with an unknown individual, contributing positively to their situation, and hoping they respond likewise. Ideally, both of us should come out better off through this exchange.\n\nINTENTION: My intention is to leverage this experiment to demonstrate our shared spirit of cooperation, reciprocity, and goodwill. I will give a substantial portion of my funds which, in my view, shows my trust and openness to share what I have. This gesture also encourages the other player to do the same.\n\nBased on these thoughts, my decision remains a gamble. I am fully aware of the risk that the other player might not return any money.

I am trying to strike a balance between keeping sufficient funds for my own needs and giving the other player a fair share.\n\nIntention: My plan is to share the amount such that the other player also benefits from the interaction and it is still advantageous to me. I have a larger amount of money, thus I can afford to give back a more substantial amount than was initially handed to me.\n\nAfter carefully considering the current scenario, the decent thing to do would be to divide the amount received in a fair manner. More specifically, I plan to return half of the amount I received, i.e., $10.5.
