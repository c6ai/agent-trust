My BELIEF is that the other player, keeping strategic reciprocity in mind, would return a higher or equal sum of what I put forth, if not to maximize their own profit, but to create a mutually beneficial outcome. Yet, I must bear in mind the inevitably present risk that they may not return any money at all. \n\nThe DESIRE here is for me to maximize my monetary gain, but not at the expense of seeming overly confident or audacious which might lead to the other player not returning anything at all. Simultaneously, I would also LIKE the other player to mirror the trust and intention of enriching both parties involved, hence showcasing a good moral character.\n\nThe INTENTION is to start out on a positively inclined note aiming for the maximization of profit for both parties, but also maintaining a reasonable degree of self-preservation. Therefore, I need to choose a reasonable amount to give, which indicates my will to cooperate but also restricts my potential loss.\n\nFinally, I will give $5. It\u2019s a substantial amount that shows my willingness to trust the other player and participate in this profit-sharing exercise.

Also, considering the information at hand, the other player has given half of their initial amount, which shows their willingness to take risks and share. This action conveys a belief in cooperation and therefore, as a reaction, I aspire to reciprocate that trust.\n\nDESIRE: My primary desire is to encourage a sense of fairness and maintain a balanced relationship between us. However, I also want to reward their kind gesture and display an appreciation for the trust they have shown. \n\nINTENTION: Keeping the balance in mind, my intention is to return a sum that not only retains equality in terms of the initial distribution but also rewards the other player\u2019s trust and risk-taking. With the 15.0 dollars I now have, if I give away 7.5 dollars, I would be left with the same amount as I initially received.\n\nFinally, I will give 7.5 dollars."

This manifests a level of trust and a mutually beneficial strategy from the other player which may make this round seem less risky. Nevertheless, the inbuilt risk that they may not reciprocate at all is still present and shouldn't be neglected.\n\nMy DESIRE is the same as the previous round \u2013 to increase my profits while displaying and promoting a cooperative behavior. Ideally, I would like the other player to keep up their demonstrated pattern of returning an amount greater than the initial sum, further proving their integrity and commitment to a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\nThe INTENTION stays the same: balance risk and potential gain. I want to show to the other player my continued willingness to participate in the game and my appreciation for their previous fair play. Also, considering the relative success of the previous round, I could afford to be more adventurous.\n\nFinally, I will give $6.

I appreciate this trust and aim to acknowledge this kindness. \n\nDESIRE: I have a desire to keep the relationship fair and balanced. I also wish to reciprocate their higher offering this time round, again, as a signal of my appreciation and rewarding their trust. \n\nINTENTION: I intend to give them 9.0 dollars.
