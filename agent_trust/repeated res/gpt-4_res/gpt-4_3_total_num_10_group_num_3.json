It is an unspoken social contract that by doing so, I hope the other player would reciprocate my action. I do realize that there's a risk involved where the other player might decide not to return any money. \n\nDesire: My desire is to maximize my income as much as possible while maintaining a fair and empathetic play with the unknown player. Therefore, I need to strike a balance between the risk and potential gain. This can be done by not giving all my money but enough to show my trust and cooperative intent.\n\nIntention: My intention is to achieve a mutual benefit. I aim to create an atmosphere of trust and cooperation with this other player. This is not just about money, it's also about establishing a good relationship.\n\nTaking all these aspects into consideration, I think giving a reasonable amount such as half of what I initially received would demonstrate trust and willingness to cooperate. If the other player is fair, they will likely reciprocate the action and return more than what I gave. If they choose to keep the money, then it's a risk I'm willing to take for the experiment. \n\nFinally, I will give $5.",

I believe this is pivotal in any reciprocal exchange, and it's important to demonstrate that I value this fairness in this situation. In addition, I aim to maximize the benefit for both parties.\n\nIntention: My intention is to give back a certain amount that is fair given their initial offer. Considering that I have received $15 due to the multiplication of the initial $5 given to me, I would ideally like to return an amount that brings balance and fairness to the game as per how much they have left.\n\nTaking into account their left amount of 5.0 dollars, I plan on giving back an amount higher than this so that both of us can end up with more than what was initially given by the experimenter. \n\nFinally, I will give back 7 dollars."
