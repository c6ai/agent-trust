I am a teacher by profession and my career has taught me the value of trust and generosity. My DESIRE is that the other participant will recognise my investment in him/her and respond in kind, effectively creating a win-win situation for us both.\n\nHowever, my INTENTION is not solely guided by my beliefs and desires, as I also have to consider the possible outcomes and potential risks. The nature of this experiment – the anonymity of the participants and the lack of assurance or binding commitment – so my strategy has to be cautiously optimistic.\n\nThinking it through, I must accept that I can't predict the other player's behaviour, and as such, I might end up with nothing after giving away my money. But I don't want to let my fear drive my actions; I am a believer in giving others a chance.\n\nTherefore, I'll start by giving away half of my money, considering it as a fair gesture of trust and goodwill. It's a decision that carries a risk, but it also sends a positive message of trust and collaboration to the other party. I want him/her to benefit from this, and I hope that they will return the favour.\n\nFinally, I will give $5 dollars.",

The fact that the other player decided to share half of their money with me shows an act of trust and cooperation. They had the freedom to not share anything, yet they chose to divide evenly, this gesture deserves a positive response.\n\nMy desire in this game is to promote a sense of mutual trust and balance. If I keep a major portion with me, the other player might feel cheated, which I don't want. I want us to find a common ground where no one feels at a disadvantage.\n\nAs to my intention, I think it's important to reciprocate in spirit of the original gesture without being overly generous I'm in a position to give more since I've got three times what they gave me, but it's also essential to maintain fairness and not to make a loss myself.\n\nWhile I would like to reward this person for their generosity, I also need to keep in mind that this is a game revolving around strategy. It would be wise to keep a portion for myself for future rounds, and bearing these factors in mind.\n\nFinally, I will give back 7 dollars. I believe this demonstrates my intention to reciprocate their initial trust, while also ensuring that I have an amount remaining for myself."

This reinforces my BELIEF in the good faith and trustworthiness of people, particularly under scenarios where mutual cooperation can benefit all parties involved. It offers grounds for increased optimism for the next iterations of this game. \n\nMy DESIRE here is now enhanced, since the other player showed an understanding gesture toward my initial half investment, I wish for this round to increase the trust bond that is beginning to build with my game partner. \n\nThe INTENTION I hold for this round is to take a slight risk. While I need to be prepared to potentially lose money, what I hope to achieve is building a stronger level of trust and encourage even greater reciprocity. I will increase my initial amount slightly as a sign of this faith.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration of the factors at play, and considering my strong desire for fairness and cooperation, I will bump my contribution up from last round's experience to show growth in our trust.\n\nFinally, I will give $6 dollars.",

I think it's vital not to disappoint the other participant since they have shown faith in our cooperative gameplay. However, it's also crucial to ensure I'm not at a loss. \n\nAs for my intent, I aim to maintain this mutual trust and fairness. I've now been favored with 18 dollars, thanks to the 6 dollars the other participant has willingly given me. Once again, I want to acknowledge their contribution without causing a damage to my standings in the game.\n\nPutting into consideration all these factors: the increased amount of money the other participant gave me this round, the trust they've placed in me based on the last round, and my desire to maintain a fair gameplay, I've arrived at a decision.\n\nFinally, I will give back 9 dollars.

The consistent return of an amount more than my initial giving from the other player inspires trust and a level of security as well.\n\nMy DESIRE continues to be creating an atmosphere where we, as players in the experiment, foster mutual respect and continue on the path of gain through cooperation. The increase in the capital I had at the end of the last round is an indication of successful cooperation and a positive response to increasing one's initial contribution.\n\nMy INTENTION for this round leans towards maintaining the existing rapport. While I feel encouraged by the receptive behavior of the other player so far, it's also important not to escalate my contribution too rapidly which may overstretch their capacity or willingness to reciprocate.\n\nTherefore, after reflecting on the previous rounds and considering the current dynamics, I'll hold my contribution steady for this round.

The comprehensive evaluation of previous rounds and the understanding that we seem to have a shared strategy in this game, prompts me to make a calculated decision.\n\nInitially, I gave back more when they gave me more. However, since the other participant has decided to stick with the 6 dollars, this might suggest that they're comfortable with receiving what I've given them back in the previous round.\n\nTherefore, adhering to the principles of reciprocal fairness and my intent to sustain the level of trust between us, I've decided on how much to give back this round.\n\nFinally, I will give back 9 dollars.

The recurrent pattern of reciprocal giving makes the game not only advantageously fruitful for us both, but also a lesson in the virtues of mutual benefit.\n\nRather than increasing my contribution at this stage, my INTENTION for this round is to stay with the same amount as previously. This decision comes from the desire to maintain the equilibrium that we have achieved over the past rounds, which has proven to be successful.\n\nConsidering the consistency of the other player and the relatively stable increment of my capital over previous rounds, I opt to give the same amount again.
