I believe in the goodness of people. I think most individuals, when given a chance to do the right thing, often do so. In crystallizing this belief to the experiment at hand, I trust that providing the other participant with a substantial amount will demonstrate my sincerity, sense of fairness, and likely spur them to act generously in return.\n\nConcerning my desires, I hope for the best possible outcome for both of us. This is not just about acquiring the best monetary gain, but also to create a precedent of trust and generosity in this experiment. Essentially, I'm hoping for a reciprocal altruistic situation, where the person will return the favor.\n\nIntending to achieve this, my strategy might lean more towards taking a risk. Statistically, the more I give, the higher the potential return. The triple echo effect of the amount I give presents an interesting opportunity. I know I run a risk that the person might not return any amount, but I believe the emulative influence of my action will permeate, and they will return a significant portion.\n\nFinally, based on these thoughts and convictions, I will give $10.",

It is a large risk they are taking, as they are left with nothing after giving me everything. \n\nDesire: I want to reward their trust and ensure their risk was not in vain. I aim to demonstrate my gratitude and contribute to a mutual and beneficial friendship, hoping they'd do the same in the future if I'm in a similar situation.\n\nIntention: Even though they expect nothing in return, as they had given up all they had, I believe in fairness. Therefore, I intend to give them a significant portion back to appreciate their generosity and reciprocate the good gesture. \n\nAfter considering these factors, my plan is to give back more than they initially offered me. This ensures fairness in our transaction and warmth in our relationship. \n\nFinally, I will give 15.0 dollars back."

It doesn't change my belief, instead, it reinforces my trust in the other person. \n\nThe outcome of the last round also influences my desire for this round. I hope that we both can trust each other during this process and that we can mutually benefit. As before, my desires for this round go beyond financial gain. I see this experiment as an opportunity to establish continued trust and mutual respect.\n\nRegarding my intentions, I plan to keep things fairly consistent given the positive outcome of the last round. The result confirms my hypothesis that demonstrating trust and generosity can yield fruitful returns. It validates my strategy of giving in order to receive.\n\nContemplating the above factors, my decision is to maintain the pattern, with a hope that the mutual trust and respect that seems to be building is not misplaced. Therefore, finally, I will give $10 once again.",

I want to continue fostering this harmonious relationship with them and respond to their kindness in kind.\n\nIntention: To mirror the good gesture, I intend to return a considerable portion back. Encouraging this cycle of generosity will hopefully fortify our relationship and promote the habit of mutual giving.\n\nConsidered together, it's crucial to keep a balance between us, I want to commend their generous actions with an equal counterplay of my own.\n\nFinally, I will give 15.0 dollars back to the other player."
